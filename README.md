# birdOS

birdOS is a small flappybird clone written in Assembly. It fit's 512 byte bootsector and runs without any operating system. And it's loaded before any operating system loaded to the machine, eventually the birdOS is the operating systems itself.

## WHY?

I wrote birdOS for having fun, and warming up my Assembly skills.

## What?
As i mentioned, birdOS is an operating system. Just not a regular one. It's a game that lives in bootsector booted by bios. It support keyboard events and very primitive graphical interface.
